# M-TAP(Mobile Tap) (In Progress)

This Project helps developers to read data from credit cards: card number, expired date, and card type .<br>
The goal is to do payments by using NFC Mobile.<br>

This NFC-based system aims to provide contactless payments through a tap. This system will eliminate
the need for a POS machine and will provide payment modes like UPI id, QR code, and SMS link.
